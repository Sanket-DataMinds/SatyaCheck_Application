# SatyaCheck Accessibility Service

## Overview

The SatyaCheck Accessibility Service is a core feature of the application that allows continuous monitoring of screen content to detect potential misinformation in real-time. This background service analyzes text displayed on your screen to identify misleading content, scams, or false information.

## How It Works

1. The service runs in the background and captures text content displayed on your screen.
2. Text is analyzed using our advanced AI engine powered by Google's Gemini API.
3. When potential misinformation is detected, you receive an immediate notification.
4. Tapping the notification takes you to a detailed analysis of the flagged content.
